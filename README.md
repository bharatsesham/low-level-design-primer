# The Low-level Design Primer
 
Low-level design (LLD) is a componenet-level design process and is frequently used while designing data structures, and algorithms.  It is also known as Object-Oriented Design (OOD), micro-level/detailed design. In general, a low-level design consists of class diagrams, program specifications and other low-level details for a given software componenet. During the LLD phase, the actual software components are designed by defining the logical and functional segments whereas design of application structure is developed during the high=level design phase. Low-level design is often created based on the high-level design. 

## Motivation

> Learn how to design a given system in an object-oriented approach.
>
> Prep for the low-level design interview.

## Low-level design interview questions with solutions

> Common low-level design interview questions with sample discussions, code, and diagrams.
>
> Solutions linked to content in the `solutions/` folder.
